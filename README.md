# Limbic-System
This is an implementation of 2 computational models for the limbic system. This project contains 2 simulations, one of which simulates the process of emotion classification, and the other simulates fear response in the limbic system.

## Emotion Classification
Source code is in the directory ```/Emotion_Classification```. For more details, click [here](https://github.com/zytyz/Limbic-System/blob/master/Emotion_Classification/Emotional_Learning.pdf).

## Fear Simulation
Source code is in the directory ```/Fear_Simulation```. For more details, click [here](https://github.com/zytyz/Limbic-System/blob/master/Fear_Simulation/Fear_Simulation.pdf).
